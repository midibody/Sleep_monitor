This is the source of code and compiled version (SleepMonitor.exe) of a small 'UI' written in Python to replace the Arduino IDE terminal to send commands to the Seeed nRF52840 board.

On top, it also draws graphs of the data returned by the board.
Just run SleepMonitor.exe from a command line.
It searches for the boards on USB ports and then you can type any command (see Quickstart doc).

With command 'p' it retrieves data and displays them in such typeof graph:

Note: once you generated a graph, you need to close the graph window popup to get back access to the UI command line.
